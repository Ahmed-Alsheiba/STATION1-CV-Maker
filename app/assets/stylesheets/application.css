/* 
 * NOTE: If you are migrating to Dart Sass, avoid using Sprockets directives like `@import` inside SCSS files.
 * Use `@use` or `@forward` instead, and manage imports via manifest files or the asset pipeline.
 * The directives below are for Sprockets and are compatible with both CSS and SCSS.
 * If you convert this file to SCSS, change the extension to `.scss` and update imports accordingly.
